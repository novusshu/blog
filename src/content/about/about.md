Over my academic career, I have systematically developed expertise in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Robotics. My research has encompassed diverse projects in natural language processing, audio and music understanding and generation, and and augmented, virtual, and mixed reality environments.

In addition to my research activities, I have been actively involved in a variety of interdisciplinary collaborations and have served as an instructor for both undergraduate and graduate courses. My teaching experience spans a broad spectrum of topics, including algorithms, web and mobile development, big data analytics, and generative AI with LLMs. Currently teaching: CS 5567 Deep Learning, CSEE 5542 Big Data Analytics and Applications, and CSEE-5590 Web and Mobile Programming.
